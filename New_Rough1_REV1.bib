  Abstract                 = {Energy loss in a fault damage zone, outside the slip zone, contributes to the fracture energy that determines rupture velocity of an earthquake. A nonelastic two-dimensional dynamic calculation is done in which the slip zone is modeled as a fault plane and material off the fault is subject to a Coulomb yield condition. In a mode 2 crack-like solution in which an abrupt uniform drop of shear traction on the fault spreads from a point, Coulomb yielding occurs on the extensional side of the fault. Plastic strain is distributed with uniform magnitude along the fault, and it has a thickness normal to the fault proportional to propagation distance. Energy loss off the fault is also proportional to propagation distance, and it can become much larger than energy loss on the fault specified by the fault constitutive relation. The slip velocity function could be produced in an equivalent elastic problem by a slip-weakening friction law with breakdown slip Dc increasing with distance. Fracture energy G and equivalent Dc will be different in ruptures with different initiation points and stress drops, so they are not constitutive properties; they are determined by the dynamic solution that arrives at a particular point. Peak slip velocity is, however, a property of a fault location. Nonelastic response can be mimicked by imposing a limit on slip velocity on a fault in an elastic medium.},

  abstract  = {J. F. ArchardAbstractThis paper examines whether the hypothesis of elastic deformation of surface protuberances is consistent with Amontons{\textquoteright}s law, that the friction is proportional to the applied load. For a single elastic contact, the area of contact A is known to be proportional to the $\frac{2}{3}$ power of the load W. Since the frictional force is generally assumed to be proportional to A, it has been thought that in elastic deformation Amontons{\textquoteright}s law would not be obeyed. However, conforming surfaces usually touch at many points, and it is shown that in these circumstances A and W become nearly proportional. Experiments are described which show that the general law is that the friction is proportional to the true area of contact; whether or not Amontons{\textquoteright}s law is obeyed depends upon the surface topography. For highly elastic materials such as Perspex, Amontons{\textquoteright}s law is obeyed when contact is made at many points, and other relations between A and W are observed when the contacts are few. Experiments with lubricated brass specimens show that the same conclusions apply to carefully prepared or well run-in metal surfaces running in conditions where the damage is small.},

  abstract  = {By comparing synthetic particle velocities with the near-source strong motion data we have constructed, by trial and error, a faulting model for the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake. The calculation of the synthetic seismograms takes into account the vertical inhomogeneity of the elastic parameters in the Imperial Valley and the spatial variation of the slip rate parameters on the fault plane. The independent slip rate parameters are (1) the strike-slip rate amplitude, (2) the dip-slip rate amplitude, (3) the duration that slip rate is nonzero (the rise time of the slip function) and (4) the rupture time, which determines when the slip rate is initiated. Our faulting model has the following principal features: (1) Faulting occurred on the Imperial fault and on the Brawley fault, rupture on the Brawley fault being triggered by rupture on the Imperial fault. (2) The Imperial fault is a plane 35 km long and 13 km wide with a strike of 323?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ°, measured clockwise from north, and a dip of 80?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ° NE.

(3) Faulting on the Imperial fault is primarily right-lateral strike slip with a small component of normal dip slip in the sediments at its northern end. The larger strike-slip rates are generally confined between depths of 5 and 13 km with maximum values of about 1.0 m/s. The duration varies on the fault with a maximum of 1.9 s, which is considerably shorter than the total time for the rupture to take place. (4) The rupture velocity on the Imperial fault is highly variable. Locally, it exceeds the shear wave velocity and, in one instance, the compressional wave velocity. The average rupture velocity, though, is less than the shear wave velocity.

In the process of trying almost 300 faulting models, we found that given the elastic parameters of the medium, the synthetic seismograms were most sensitive to the specification of the rupture time. Although the slip rate amplitudes are linearly related to the data, the rupture time and the duration are not. The parameterization of the nonlinear variables has a strong effect on the generation of synthetic seismograms from a finite fault.},

We find no systematic dependence of apparent stress or stress drop on seismic moment for these sequences, and find they both are log-normally distributed; however, we identify several anomalous events - both energetic and enervated - that show sharply different spectral signatures from the rest of the population. These events indicate that much of the variation in apparent stress and stress drop is statistically significant, which may have important implications for seismic hazard analysis.},

  abstract  = {We present a technique to infer the rupture history of an earthquake from near-source records of ground motion. Unlike most previous studies, each point on the fault is assumed to slip only once, when the rupture front passes, with a spatially variable slip intensity. In this parameterization the data are linearly related to slip intensity but nonlinearly related to rupture time. We perform a linearized inversion for slip intensity and rupture time by iteratively perturbing an assumed starting model. The inverse problem for the model perturbation is solved using a tomographic back projection technique. Smoothing and inequality constraints are applied to ensure that the resulting solution is stable and feasible. Asymptotic ray theory is used to calculate theoretical seismograms and partial derivatives with respect to model parameters. In test cases with noisy synthetic data sets we found that it is possible to distinguish between rupture models having variable slip amplitude and models having variable rupture velocity, provided the station coverage is adequate. We apply the technique to recordings of the April 24, 1984, Morgan Hill earthquake. The results indicate that slip amplitude on the fault plane was extremely variable and that the rupture front did not propagate uniformly away from the hypocenter. In particular, rupture was delayed on a 12 km2 section of the fault approximately 14 km to the southeast of the hypocenter. The rupture front surrounded the region, which subsequently failed with a component of rupture propagation back toward the hypocenter. Similar behavior has been observed in dynamic rupture models with stress or strength inhomogeneities. This segment of the fault ruptured with a large slip amplitude, releasing 12\% of the total seismic moment from 4\% of the total area of the aftershock zone. The surface trace of this section of the fault is characterized by a complex left step that could act to increase the normal stress acting across the fault. However, the distribution of aftershocks suggests that the fault at depth is simpler and that it may bend to the right. In either case, our rupture model suggests that this segment of the fault represents an asperity, which initially resisted rupture but eventually ruptured massively. We estimate the shear fracture energy for this earthquake to be 2?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ106 J/m2.},

  abstract  = {--- A simple and powerful method for simulating ground motions is to combine parametric or functional descriptions of the ground motion's amplitude spectrum with a random phase spectrum modified such that the motion is distributed over a duration related to the earthquake magnitude and to the distance from the source. This method of simulating ground motions often goes by the name ``the stochastic method.'' It is particularly useful for simulating the higher-frequency ground motions of most interest to engineers (generally, f>0.1 Hz), and it is widely used to predict ground motions for regions of the world in which recordings of motion from potentially damaging earthquakes are not available. This simple method has been successful in matching a variety of ground-motion measures for earthquakes with seismic moments spanning more than 12 orders of magnitude and in diverse tectonic environments. One of the essential characteristics of the method is that it distills what is known about the various factors affecting ground motions (source, path, and site) into simple functional forms. This provides a means by which the results of the rigorous studies reported in other papers in this volume can be incorporated into practical predictions of ground motion.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical models are presented to describe the evolution of the surface roughness of polishing pads during the pad-conditioning process in chemical-mechanical polishing. The models describe the evolution of the surface-height probability-density function of solid pads during fixed height or fixed cut-rate conditioning. An integral equation is derived for the effect of conditioning on a foamed pad in terms of a model for a solid pad. The models that combine wear and conditioning are then discussed for both solid and foamed pads. Models include the dependence of the surface roughness on the shape and density of the cutting tips used in the conditioner and on other operating parameters. Good agreement is found between the model, Monte Carlo simulations and with experimental data.},

  abstract  = {We measure the elastic and dissipative responses of a multi-contact interface, formed between the rough surfaces of two contacting macroscopic solids, submitted to a biased oscillating shear force. We evidence that, beyond a linear viscoelastic regime, observed at low shear amplitude, the interface response exhibits a dissipative component that corresponds to the onset of frictional dissipation. The latter regime exists, whereas the tangential force applied, far from the nominal static threshold, does not provoke any sliding. This result, akin to that of Mindlin for a single contact, leads us to extend his model of {\textquoteleft}microslip{\textquoteright} to the case of an interface composed of multiple microcontacts. While describing satisfactorily the elastic response, the model fails to account quantitatively for the observed energy dissipation, which, we believe, results from the fact that the key assumption of local Coulomb friction in Mindlin{\textquoteright}s model is not legitimate at the sub-micrometre scale of the microslip zones within microcontacts between surface asperities.},

  abstract  = {The Greenwood and Williamson theory of contact has been widely accepted, and perhaps does contain the essential feature needed: that asperities should have a height distribution which approximates to a simple exponential in the relevant range of heights. The Gaussian height distribution often found experimentally does indeed approximate to an exponential as required. It appears that Greenwood and Williamson's second assumption, that asperities may be treated as having spherical caps and as being identical except for their heights, is also useful: little is gained by treating the asperities as ellipsoids, or by introducing a distribution of asperity sizes. But a third, tacit, assumption, that 'peaks' on a surface profile -- points higher than their immediate neighbours at the sampling interval used -- correspond to asperities is quite wrong, and gives a false idea of both the number and the radius of curvature of the asperities. Instead we need to return to the earlier Archard concept that roughness consists of 'protuberances on protuberances on protuberances', and perhaps also to another Archard idea, the paradox that contact may be plastic at light loads but become elastic at heavier loads!},

  Abstract                 = {A variety of geophysical observations suggests that the upper portion of the lithosphere, herein referred to as the elastic plate, has long-term material properties and frictional strength significantly greater than the lower lithosphere. If the average frictional stress along the non-ridge margin of the elastic plate is of the order of a kilobar, as suggested by the many observations of the frictional strength of rocks at mid-crustal conditions of pressure and temperature, the only viable mechanism for driving the motion of the elastic plate is a basal shear stress of several tens of bars. Kilobars of tectonic stress are then an ambient, steady condition of the earth's crust and uppermost mantle. The approximate equality of the basal shear stress and the average crustal earthquake stress drop, the localization of strain release for major plate margin earthquakes, and the rough equivalence of plate margin slip rates and gross plate motion rates suggest that the stress drops of major plate margin earthquakes are controlled by the elastic release of the basal shear stress in the vicinity of the plate margin, despite the existence of kilobars of tectonic stress existing across vertical planes parallel to the plate margin. If the stress differences available to be released at the time of faulting are distributed in a random, white fasbion with a mean-square value determined by the average earthquake stress drop, the frequency of occurrence of constant stress drop earthquakes will be proportional to reciprocal faulting area, in accordance with empirically known frequency of occurrence statistics.},

  abstract  = {AbstractLarge variability of earthquake stress drops and scaled energy has been commonly reported in the literature, but it is difficult to assess how much of this variability is caused by underlying physical source processes rather than simply observational uncertainties. Here we examine a variety of dynamically realistic rupture scenarios for circular and elliptical faults and investigate to what extent the variability in seismically estimated stress drops and scaled energy comes from differences in source geometry, rupture directivity, and rupture speeds. We numerically simulate earthquake source scenarios using a cohesive-zone model with the small-scale yielding limit, where the solution approaches a singular crack model with spontaneous healing of slip. Compared to symmetrical circular source models, asymmetrical models result in larger variability of estimated corner frequencies and scaled energy over the focal sphere. The general behavior of the spherical averages of corner frequencies and scaled energy in the subshear regime extends to the supershear regime, although shear Mach waves generated by the propagation of supershear rupture lead to much higher corner frequency and scaled energy estimates locally. Our results suggest that at least a factor of 2 difference in the spherical average of corner frequencies is expected in observational studies simply from variability in source characteristics almost independent of the actual stress drops, translating into a factor of 8 difference in estimated stress drops. Furthermore, radiation efficiency estimates derived from observed seismic spectra should not be directly interpreted as describing rupture properties unless there are independent constraints on rupture speed and geometry.},

  abstract  = {The seismic moment is related by definition to the average slip on the fault plane of an earthquake. Here we derive an exact expression for the seismic moment in terms of a general heterogeneous stress drop distribution and the geometry of the fault of a complex event. We find that the seismic moment is proportional to a weighted integral of the stress drop on the fault. The weight in this linear relationship is the slip for a hypothetical event with the same source geometry but uniform stress drop. This relationship between seismic moment and stress drop depends on geometry. In particular, for multiple sources the weight is reduced by factors of the order of ??/R, where ?? is the radius of a typical subfault and R is the radius of the total source area. As a consequence of these results we find that for a given stress drop, a simple fault generates a larger seismic moment than a multiple fault of the same total surface. Conversely, for a given moment and source area, a complex event would need higher stress drops on the subfaults than a simple smooth fault. We test these results with three rectangular models of faulting. The first is a simple, smooth fault with uniform stress drop. The second model is a simple fault with zero stress drop in the central section of the fault. The last model is a complex event where the central section of the fault remains unbroken. We show that the last two models are difficult to distinguish from their far-field radiation.},

  abstract  = {We present a theory for the radiation of high-frequency waves by earthquake faults. We model the fault as a planar region in which the stress drops to the kinematic friction during slip. This model is entirely equivalent to a shear crack. For two-dimensional fault models we show that the high frequencies originate from the stress and slip velocity concentrations in the vicinity of the fault's edges. These stress concentrations radiate when the crack expands with accelerated motion. The most efficient generation of high-frequency waves occurs when the rupture velocity changes abruptly. In this case, the displacement spectrum has an ?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ-2 behaviour at high frequencies. The excitation is proportional to the intensity of the stress concentration near the crack tips and to the change in the focusing factor due to rupture velocity. We extend these two-dimensional results to more general three-dimensional fault models in the case when the rupture velocity changes simultaneously on the rupture front. Results are similar to those described for two-dimensional faults. We apply the theory to the case of a circular fault that grows at constant velocity and stops suddenly. The present theory is in excellent agreement with a numerical solution of the same problem. Our results provide upper bounds to the high-frequency radiation from more realistic models in which rupture velocity does not change suddenly. The ?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ-2 is the minimum possible decay at high frequencies for any crack model of the source.},

  abstract  = {Geological faults comprise large-scale segmentation and small-scale roughness. These multi-scale geometrical complexities determine the dynamics of the earthquake rupture process, and therefore affect the radiated seismic wavefield. In this study, we examine how different parameterizations of fault roughness lead to variability in the rupture evolution and the resulting near-fault ground motions. Rupture incoherence naturally induced by fault roughness generates high-frequency radiation that follows an $\omega$-2 decay in displacement amplitude spectra. Because dynamic rupture simulations are computationally expensive, we test several kinematic source approximations designed to emulate the observed dynamic behavior. When simplifying the rough-fault geometry, we find that perturbations in local moment tensor orientation are important, while perturbations in local source location are not. Thus, a planar fault can be assumed if the local strike, dip, and rake are maintained. We observe that dynamic rake angle variations are anti-correlated with the local dip angles. Testing two parameterizations of dynamically consistent Yoffe-type source-time function, we show that the seismic wavefield of the approximated kinematic ruptures well reproduces the radiated seismic waves of the complete dynamic source process. This finding opens a new avenue for an improved pseudo-dynamic source characterization that captures the effects of fault roughness on earthquake rupture evolution. By including also the correlations between kinematic source parameters, we outline a new pseudo-dynamic rupture modeling approach for broadband ground-motion simulation.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Earthquake onsets provide a unique opportunity to study physical rupture processes because they are more easily observable than later rupture stages. Despite this relative simplicity, the observational basis for rupture onsets is unclear. Numerous reports of evidence for magnitude-dependent rupture onsets (which imply deterministic rupture behavior) stand in contradiction to a large body of physics-based rupture modeling efforts, which are mostly based on inherently nondeterministic principles. Here we make use of the abundance of short-distance recordings available today; a magnitude dependency of onsets should appear most prominently in such recordings. We use a simple method to demonstrate that all ruptures in the studied magnitude range (4?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ<?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂM?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ<?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ8) share a universal initial rupture behavior and discuss ensuing implications for physical rupture processes and earthquake early warning.},

  Abstract                 = {Slow earthquakes are characterized by a wide spectrum of fault slip behaviors and seismic radiation patterns that differ from those of traditional earthquakes. However, slow earthquakes and huge megathrust earthquakes can have common slip mechanisms and are located in neighboring regions of the seismogenic zone. The frequent occurrence of slow earthquakes may help to reveal the physics underlying megathrust events as useful analogs. Slow earthquakes may function as stress meters because of their high sensitivity to stress changes in the seismogenic zone. Episodic stress transfer to megathrust source faults leads to an increased probability of triggering huge earthquakes if the adjacent locked region is critically loaded. Careful and precise monitoring of slow earthquakes may provide new information on the likelihood of impending huge earthquakes.},

This relation is based on the constitutive features during slip failure instabilities revealed in the careful laboratory experiments. These experiments show that the shear stress first increases with ongoing slip during the dynamic breakdown process, the peak stress is attained at a very (usually negligibly) small but nonzero value of the slip displacement, and then the slip-weakening instability proceeds. The model leads to bounded slip acceleration and stresses at and near the dynamically propagating tip of the slipping zone along the fault in an elastic continuum. The dynamic behavior near the propagating tip of the slipping zone calculated from the theoretical model agrees with those observed during slip failure along the preexisting fault much larger than the cohesive zone. The model predicts that the maximum slip acceleration be related to the maximum slip velocity and the critical displacement Dc by , where k is a numerical parameter, taking a value ranging from 4.9 to 7.2 according to a value of ?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂi/?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂp (?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂp being the peak shear stress) in the present model. The model further predicts that be expressed in terms of and the cut off frequency fmaxs of the power spectral density of the slip acceleration on the fault plane as and that in terms of Dc and fmaxs as . These theoretical relations agree well with the experimental observations and can explain interrelations between strong motion source parameters for earthquakes. The pulse width of slip acceleration on the fault plane is directly proportional to the time Tc required for the crack tip to break down, and fmaxs is inversely proportional to Tc.},

The dynamic rupture reproduces the general slip pattern used to compute the initial stress distribution and generates near-fault ground motions at the surface similar to observations. The simulated rupture propagates on the fault along a complex path with highly variable speed and rise time, changing the magnitude and pattern of the stress significantly.

  abstract  = {Abstract The accurate determination of stress drop, seismic efficiency, and how source parameters scale with earthquake size is an important issue for seismic hazard assessment of induced seismicity. We propose an improved nonparametric, data-driven strategy suitable for monitoring induced seismicity, which combines the generalized inversion technique together with genetic algorithms. In the first step of the analysis the generalized inversion technique allows for an effective correction of waveforms for attenuation and site contributions. Then, the retrieved source spectra are inverted by a nonlinear sensitivity-driven inversion scheme that allows accurate estimation of source parameters. We therefore investigate the earthquake source characteristics of 633 induced earthquakes (Mw 2?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ3.8) recorded at The Geysers geothermal field (California) by a dense seismic network (i.e., 32 stations, more than 17.000 velocity records).

All these findings suggest different dynamic rupture processes for smaller and larger earthquakes and that the proportion of high-frequency energy radiation and the amount of energy required to overcome the friction or for the creation of new fractures surface changes with earthquake size. Furthermore, we observe also two distinct families of events with peculiar source parameters that in one case suggests the reactivation of deep structures linked to the regional tectonics, while in the other supports the idea of an important role of steeply dipping faults in the fluid pressure diffusion.},

Relevant weakening processes in large crustal events are therefore suggested to be thermal, and to involve the following: (1) thermal pressurization of pore fluid within and adjacent to the deforming fault core, which reduces the effective normal stress and hence also the shear strength for a given friction coefficient and (2) flash heating at highly stressed frictional microcontacts during rapid slip, which reduces the friction coefficient. (Macroscopic melting, or possibly gel formation in silica-rich lithologies, may become important too at large enough slip.) Theoretical modeling of mechanisms 1 and 2 is constrained with lab-determined hydrologic and poroelastic properties of fault core materials and lab friction studies at high slip rates. Predictions are that strength drop should often be nearly complete at large slip and that the onset of melting should be precluded over much (and, for small enough slip, all) of the seismogenic zone. A testable prediction is of the shear fracture energies that would be implied if actual earthquake ruptures were controlled by those thermal mechanisms. Seismic data have been compiled on the fracture energy of crustal events, including its variation with slip in an event. It is plausibly described by theoretical predictions based on the above mechanisms, within a considerable range of uncertainty of parameter choices, thus allowing the possibility that such thermal weakening prevails in the Earth.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Nonvolcanic tremors (NVTs) are observed in transition zones between freely slipping and locked sections of faults and normally occur below the seismogenic zone. Based on NVT recordings in the Parkfield region of the San Andreas Fault, we provide a novel approach to assess the energy release of these events and assign magnitudes (Me) that are compatible with size estimates of small earthquakes in the same region. To assess the energy magnitude of a detected tremor, we refine the estimate of its duration and perform a spectral analysis that accounts for local attenuation. For the 218 NVTs that we were able to process, we resolve Me values in the range of ??Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ0.67 to 0.84. For events, which we could not process using the spectral analysis technique, we propose a statistical model to estimate Me values using observable characteristics, such as peak amplitude, spectral velocity at the source corner frequency, and duration. We furthermore provide seismic moment and moment magnitude estimates and calculate stress drops in a range of 3?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ10?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂkPa.

  abstract  = {Summary In the shallow brittle crust, following earthquake ruptures, geophysical observations show a dramatic drop of seismic wave speeds in the shallow off-fault medium. Seismic ruptures generate, or reactivate, damage around faults that alter the constitutive response of the surrounding medium, which in turn modifies the earthquake itself, the seismic radiation, and the near-fault ground motion. This numerical study aims to assess the interplay between earthquake ruptures and dynamically evolving off-fault medium and to underline the damage-related features pertinent to interpret geophysical observations. We present a micromechanics-based constitutive model that account for dynamic evolution of elastic moduli at high-strain rates. We consider 2D inplane models, with a 1D right lateral fault featuring slip-weakening friction law. We demonstrate that the response of the damaged elastic solid is different in the compressional and tensional quadrant. We observe that dynamic damage induces a reduction in elastic moduli and produces slip rate oscillations that result in high-frequency content in the radiated ground motion, consistent with strong motion records. We underline the importance of incorporating off-fault medium history in earthquake rupture processes. We find that dynamic damage generation is sensitive to material contrast and that it introduces an additional asymmetry beyond that of a bimaterial fault, in agreement with experimental studies.},

These events were recorded at 45 surface stations and 2 borehole stations. The data set is unique in that most events have high signal-to-noise ratio at several surface stations and at the two borehole stations. The redundancy provided by the large number of stations recording these events allows us to assess the uncertainty of our results. We find that the seismic energy to moment (ER/M0) ratios from P waves for the events in our data set are reliable, that they vary between 1 ?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ 10??Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ6 and 1 ?Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ 10??Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ4, and that smaller events tend to have smaller values of ER/M0 because they are relatively deficient in radiated energy above the corner frequency.

The moment magnitude (Mw) 8.1 Iquique earthquake of 1 April 2014 broke a highly coupled portion of this gap. To understand the seismicity preceding this event, we studied the location and mechanisms of the foreshocks and computed Global Positioning System (GPS) time series at stations located on shore. Seismicity off the coast of Iquique started to increase in January 2014. After 16 March, several Mw > 6 events occurred near the low-coupled zone. These events migrated northward for ~50 kilometers until the 1 April earthquake occurred. On 16 March, on-shore continuous GPS stations detected a westward motion that we model as a slow slip event situated in the same area where the mainshock occurred.},

  abstract = {Abstract Preparatory mechanisms accompanying or leading to nucleation of larger earthquakes have been observed at both laboratory and field scale, but conditions favoring the occurrence of observable preparatory processes are still largely unknown. In particular, it remains a matter of debate why some earthquakes occur spontaneously without noticeable precursors as opposed to events that are preceded by an extended failure process. In this study, we have generated new high-resolution seismicity catalogs framing the occurrence of 20 ML > 2.5 earthquakes at The Geysers geothermal field in California. To this end, a seismicity catalog of the 11 days framing each large event was created. We selected 20 sequences sampling different hypocentral depths and hydraulic conditions within the field. Seismic activity and magnitude frequency distributions displayed by the different earthquake sequences are correlated with their location within the reservoir. Sequences located in the northwestern part of the reservoir show overall increased seismic activity and low b-values, while the southeastern part is dominated by decreased seismic activity and higher b-values. Periods of high injection coincide with high b-values, and vice versa. These observations potentially reflect varying differential and mean stresses and damage of the reservoir rocks across the field. About 50 \% of analyzed sequences exhibit no change in seismicity rate in response to the large main event. However, we find complex waveforms at the onset of the main earthquake, suggesting that small ruptures spontaneously grow into or trigger larger events.},

Here we characterize the long-term precursory phase of the 1 April 2014 Mw8.1 North Chile megathrust. We show that a group of coastal GPS stations accelerated westward 8 months before the main shock, corresponding to a Mw6.5 slow slip event on the subduction interface, 80\% of which was aseismic. Concurrent interface foreshocks underwent a diminution of their radiation at high frequency, as shown by the temporal evolution of Fourier spectra and residuals with respect to ground motions predicted by recent subduction models. Such ground motions change suggests that in response to the slow sliding of the subduction interface, seismic ruptures are progressively becoming smoother and/or slower. The gradual propagation of seismic ruptures beyond seismic asperities into surrounding metastable areas could explain these observations and might be the precursory mechanism eventually leading to the main shock.},

The nature of the transient forcing may vary across sequences and range from aseismic creeping or transient slip to diffusion of pore pressure pulses to fluid redistribution and migration within the seismogenic crust.

Here we study the ongoing Pollino range (Southern Italy) seismic swarm, a long-lasting seismic sequence with more than five thousand events recorded and located since October 2010. The two largest shocks (magnitude Mw = 4.2 and Mw = 5.1) are among the largest earthquakes ever recorded in an area which represents a seismic gap in the Italian historical earthquake catalogue. We investigate the geometrical, mechanical and statistical characteristics of the largest earthquakes and of the entire swarm. We calculate the focal mechanisms of the Ml \\&gt; 3 events in the sequence and the transfer of Coulomb stress on nearby known faults and analyse the statistics of the earthquake catalogue. We find that only 25 per cent of the earthquakes in the sequence can be explained as aftershocks, and the remaining 75 per cent may be attributed to a transient forcing. The b-values change in time throughout the sequence, with low b-values correlated with the period of highest rate of activity and with the occurrence of the largest shock.

  abstract = {Abstract While many large earthquakes are preceded by observable foreshocks, the mechanism responsible for the occurrence of these smaller-scale seismic events remains uncertain. One physical explanation of foreshocks with growing support is that they are produced by the interaction of slow slip with fault heterogeneity. Inspired by the suggestion from laboratory experiments that foreshocks occur on fault asperities (bumps), we explore rate-and-state fault models with patches of higher normal stress embedded in a larger seismogenic region by conducting 3-D numerical simulations of their behavior over long-term sequences of aseismic and seismic slips. The models do produce smaller-scale seismicity during the aseismic nucleation of larger-scale seismic events. These smaller-scale events have reasonable stress drops, despite the highly elevated compression assigned to the source patches. We find that the two main factors contributing to the reasonable stress drops are the significant extent of the rupture into the region surrounding the patches and the aseismic stress release just prior to the seismic events. The smaller-scale seismicity can only occur if a sufficient separation in nucleation scales between the foreshock-like events and mainshocks is achieved. Our modeling provides insight into the conditions conducive for generating foreshocks on both natural and laboratory faults.},

In the simulation, the time evolution of a multi-degree-of-freedom system with Coulomb friction was studied. The model considered in the simulation comprised multiple masses serially connected by linear springs on a stationary rigid plane. By regarding the precursor in the experiment to correspond to a partial slip (i.e., simultaneous slip of some of the masses) in the simulation, the influence of non-uniform normal loading on the precursor events can be explained to a certain extent. Additionally, it was found that the apparent static friction coefficient (i.e., the ratio of the maximum tangential load to the total normal load) could be lesser than the real static friction coefficient due to the residual strain in the slider.},

Recent experimental results showed a close relation between this speed and the local ratio of shear to normal stress measured before slip occurs (static stress ratio). Using a two-dimensional finite element model, we demonstrate, however, that fronts propagating in different directions do not have the same dynamics under similar stress conditions. A lack of correlation is also observed between accelerating and decelerating slip fronts. These effects cannot be entirely associated with static local stresses but call for a dynamic description. Considering a dynamic stress ratio (measured in front of the slip tip) instead of a static one reduces the above-mentioned inconsistencies. However, the effects of the direction and acceleration are still present. To overcome this, we propose an energetic criterion that uniquely associates, independently on the direction of propagation and its acceleration, the slip front velocity with the relative rise of the energy density at the slip tip.},

We develop a theoretical model based on linear elastic fracture mechanics to describe the propagation of such precursory slip. The model's prediction of precursor lengths as a function of external load is in good quantitative agreement with laboratory experiments as well as with dynamic simulations, and provides thereby evidence to recognize frictional slip as a fracture phenomenon. We show that predicted precursor lengths depend, within given uncertainty ranges, mainly on the kinetic friction coefficient, and only weakly on other interface and material parameters. By simplifying the fracture mechanics model, we also reveal sources for the observed nonlinearity in the growth of precursor lengths as a function of the applied force. The discrete nature of precursors as well as the shear tractions caused by frustrated Poisson's expansion is found to be the dominant factors. Finally, we apply our model to a different, symmetric setup and provide a prediction of the propagation distance of frictional slip for future experiments.},

  abstract  = {Summary The topography of natural faults and fractures has been measured over nearly the entire band: 105 M to 10?5 M. It is found that the surfaces are fractal or nearly fractal over this entire band but that the fractal dimension, D, is a function of spatial frequency. Both abrupt and gradual transitions in D are observed and over some scales, most notably at the high and low ends of the spectral band studied, the surfaces are smooth enough to be differentiable, i.e., they are Euclidean. From these results we can deduce that the asperity distribution on faults obeys an inverse power law and that fault roughness scales with spatial wavelength. The constants in these relationships, however, depend on D, and hence hold over only limited spatial bands. On the scale of frictional sliding during an earthquake, rms roughness and asperity size scale up with slip, so that in slip-weakening models of the stick-slip instability the critical distance, dc, will also be expected to scale with slip and hence earthquake size. As a result, the energy release rate G can also be expected to increase with rupture size and slip weakening models in which dc is a fixed parameter may not be realistic. At longer wavelengths, the fractal nature of fault geometry provides a simple explanation for the randomness of strong ground motions and of the size distributions of earthquakes and faults. That large and small earthquakes belong to different hierarchies of size distributions is consistent with their different scaling relations.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effect of fault surface roughness on rupture preparation characteristics using meter-scale metagabbro specimens. We repeatedly conducted the experiments with the same pair of rock specimens to make the fault surface rough. We obtained three experimental results under the same experimental conditions (6.7?MPa of normal stress and 0.01?mm/s of loading rate) but at different roughness conditions (smooth, moderately roughened, and heavily roughened). During each experiment, we observed many stick-slip events preceded by precursory slow slip. We investigated when and where slow slip initiated by using the strain gauge data processed by the Kalman filter algorithm. The observed rupture preparation processes on the smooth fault (i.e. the first experiment among the three) showed high repeatability of the spatiotemporal distributions of slow slip initiation. Local stress measurements revealed that slow slip initiated around the region where the ratio of shear to normal stress (?/?) was the highest as expected from finite element method (FEM) modeling. However, the exact location of slow slip initiation was where ?/? became locally minimum, probably due to the frictional heterogeneity. In the experiment on the moderately roughened fault, some irregular events were observed, though the basic characteristics of other regular events were similar to those on the smooth fault. Local stress data revealed that the spatiotemporal characteristics of slow slip initiation and the resulting ?/? drop for irregular events were different from those for regular ones even under similar stress conditions. On the heavily roughened fault, the location of slow slip initiation was not consistent with ?/? anymore because of the highly heterogeneous static friction on the fault, which also decreased the repeatability of spatiotemporal distributions of slow slip initiation. These results suggest that fault surface roughness strongly controls the rupture preparation process, and generally increases its complexity with the degree of roughness.},

  abstract  = {Summary Fault slip surfaces and earthquake surface ruptures are not flat but show corrugations at all scales, also called roughness. These corrugations control the distribution of stress and strength on the fault plane and around. Here, we review the scaling properties of faults and earthquake slip roughness. Interestingly, both fault and earthquake datasets show power-law geometrical properties with similar scaling exponents, which indicate the existence of long-range spatial correlations. Several mechanisms are identified that control fault roughness, such as wear during slip and growth of a fault, by linking shear fracture segments. Scaling exponents are also found in numerical models where a rupture propagates into an elastic medium that contains mechanical heterogeneities: the roughness scaling emerges from the long-range elastic interactions and the pinning of the slip front by heterogeneities. Finally, several questions remain open on the effect of roughness on fault slip and could be the topic of future studies: (i) Is aseismic slip controlled by roughness? (ii) Is small scale-roughness (below millimeter scale) different from larger scale roughness and how does it record processes occurring during dynamic rupture and/or during fault healing? (iii) How do plastic and elastic processes interact to modify roughness and faulting?},

  abstract = {Abundant geological, seismological and experimental evidence of the heterogeneous structure of natural faults motivates the theoretical and computational study of the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous frictional fault interfaces. Fault zones are composed of a mixture of materials with contrasting strength, which may affect the spatial variability of seismic coupling, the location of high-frequency radiation and the diversity of slip behavior observed in natural faults. To develop a quantitative understanding of the effect of strength heterogeneity on the mechanical behavior of faults, here we investigate a fault model with spatially variable frictional properties and pore pressure. Conceptually, this model may correspond to two rough surfaces in contact along discrete asperities, the space in between being filled by compressed gouge. The asperities have different permeability than the gouge matrix and may be hydraulically sealed, resulting in different pore pressure. We consider faults governed by rate-and-state friction, with mixtures of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening materials and contrasts of effective normal stress. We systematically study the diversity of slip behaviors generated by this model through multi-cycle simulations and linear stability analysis. The fault can be either stable without spontaneous slip transients, or unstable with spontaneous rupture. When the fault is unstable, slip can rupture either part or the entire fault. In some cases the fault alternates between these behaviors throughout multiple cycles. We determine how the fault behavior is controlled by the proportion of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening materials, their relative strength and other frictional properties. We also develop, through heuristic approximations, closed-form equations to predict the stability of slip on heterogeneous faults. Our study shows that a fault model with heterogeneous materials and pore pressure contrasts is a viable framework to reproduce the full spectrum of fault behaviors observed in natural faults: from fast earthquakes, to slow transients, to stable sliding. In particular, this model constitutes a building block for models of episodic tremor and slow slip events.},

  abstract = {It has been shown that the onset of frictional instability is characterized by a transition from stable, quasi-static rupture growth to unstable, inertially-controlled high-speed rupture. In particular, slow rupture fronts propagating at a steady speed Vslow of the order of 5\% of the S-wave speed have been observed prior to the onset of dynamic rupture in recent fault-friction laboratory experiments. However, the precise mechanism governing this Vslow stage is unknown. Here we reproduce this phenomenon in numerical simulations of earthquake sequences that incorporate laboratory-derived rate-and-state friction laws. Our simulations show that the Vslow stage originates from a stress concentration inherited from the coalescence of interseismic slow creep fronts. Its occurrence is limited to a narrow range of the parameter space but is found in simulations with two commonly-used state-variable evolution laws in the rate-and-state formulation. The sensitivity of the speed Vslow to the model parameters suggests that the propagation speed Vslow reported in laboratory experiments may also be sensitive to parameters of friction and stress conditions. Our results imply that time and space dimensions associated with the propagation of Vslow on natural faults can be as much as a few seconds and several hundred meters, respectively. Hence the detection of such preseismic signals may be possible with near-field high-resolution observations.},

Similar precursory slip phenomena have also been observed in laboratory studies of shear rupture nucleation on frictional interfaces. However, the mechanisms that govern rupture nucleation, even in idealized laboratory settings, have been widely debated. Here we show that a numerical model incorporating rate-and-state friction laws and elastic continuum can reproduce the behaviors of rupture nucleation seen in laboratory experiments. In particular, we find that both in laboratory experiments and simulations with a wide range of normal stresses, the nucleation consists of two distinct phases: initial slow propagation phase and faster acceleration phase, both of which are likely aseismic processes, followed by dynamic rupture propagation that radiates seismic waves. The distance at which the rupture transitions from the initial slow phase to the acceleration phase can be roughly predicted by a theoretical estimate of critical nucleation length. Our results further show that the critical nucleation length depends on the background loading rate. In addition, our analysis suggests that critical nucleation length and breakdown power derived from the Griffith crack energy balance control the scaling of nucleating ruptures. Moreover, the background loading rate and loading configuration significantly affect the rupture propagation speed. Furthermore, if the same nucleation mechanism applies to natural faults, the migration speed of foreshocks triggered by the propagation of slow rupture within the nucleation zone would depend on the effective normal stress and hence fluid pressure in the fault zone.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional analyses are reported of slip on a long vertical strike-slip fault between steadily driven elastic crustal blocks. A rate- and state-dependent friction law governs motion on the fault; the law includes a characteristic slip distance L for evolution of surface state and slip weakening. Because temperature and normal stress vary with depth, frictional constitutive properties (velocity weakening/strengthening) do also. Those properties are taken either as uniform along-strike at every depth or as perturbed modestly from uniformity. The governing equations of quasi-static elasticity and frictional slip are solved on a computational grid of cells as a discrete numerical system, and a viscous radiation damping term is included to approximately represent inertial control of slip rates during earthquake-like instabilities. The numerical results show richly complex slip, with a spectrum of event sizes, when solved for a grid with oversized cells, that is, with cell size h that is too large to validly represent the underlying continuous system of equations. However, in every case for which it has been feasible to do the computations (moderately large L only), that spatio-temporally complex slip disappears in favor of simple limit cycles of periodically repeated large earthquakes with reduction of cell size h. Further study will be necessary to determine whether a similar transition occurs when the elastodynamics of rupture propagation is treated more exactly, rather than in the radiation damping approximation. The transition from complex to ordered fault response occurs as h is reduced below a theoretically derived nucleation size h* which scales with L but is 2 Ã???????Ã?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ 104 to 105 larger in cases considered. Cells larger than h* can fail independently of one another, whereas those much smaller than h* cannot slip unstably alone and can do so only as part of a cooperating group of cells. The results contradict an emergent view that spatio-temporal complexity is a generic feature of mechanical fault models. Such generic complexity does apparently result from models which are inherently discrete in the sense of having no well-defined continuum limit as h diminishes. Those models form a different class of dynamical systems from models like the present one that do have a continuum limit. Strongly oversized cells cause the model developed here to mimic an inherently discrete system. It is suggested that oversized cells, capable of failing independently of one another, may crudely represent geometrically disordered fault zones, with quasi-independent fault segments that join one another at kinks or jogs. Such geometric disorder, at scales larger than h*, may force a system with a well-defined continuum limit to mimic an inherently discrete system and show spatio-temporally complex slip at those larger scales.},

In contrast, mature plate-boundary faults like the San Andreas Fault (SAF) operate at ?b/?eff?0.2. Dynamic weakening, the dramatic reduction in frictional resistance at coseismic slip velocities that is commonly observed in laboratory experiments, provides a leading explanation for low stress levels on mature faults. Strongly velocity-weakening friction laws permit rupture propagation on flat faults above a critical stress level ?pulse/?eff?0.25. Provided that dynamic weakening is not restricted to mature faults, the higher stress levels on most faults are puzzling. In this work, we present a self-consistent explanation for the relatively high stress levels on immature faults that is compatible with low coseismic frictional resistance, from dynamic weakening, for all faults. We appeal to differences in structural complexity with the premise that geometric irregularities introduce resistance to slip in addition to frictional resistance. This general idea is quantified for the special case of self-similar fractal roughness of the fault surface. Natural faults have roughness characterized by amplitude-to-wavelength ratios ? between 10?3 and 10?2. Through a second-order boundary perturbation analysis of quasi-static frictionless sliding across a band-limited self-similar interface in an ideally elastic solid, we demonstrate that roughness induces an additional shear resistance to slip, or roughness drag, given by ?drag=8?3?2G??/?min, for G?=G/(1??) with shear modulus Gand Poisson's ratio ?, slip ?, and minimum roughness wavelength ?min. The influence of roughness drag on fault mechanics is verified through an extensive set of dynamic rupture simulations of earthquakes on strongly rate-weakening fractal faults with elastic-plastic off-fault response. The simulations suggest that fault rupture, in the form of self-healing slip pulses, becomes probable above a background stress level ?b??pulse+?drag. For the smoothest faults (??10?3), ?drag is negligible compared to frictional resistance, so that ?b??pulse?0.25?eff. However, on rougher faults (??10?2), roughness drag can exceed frictional resistance. We expect that ?drag ultimately departs from the predicted scaling when roughness-induced stress perturbations activate pervasive off-fault inelastic deformation, such that background stress saturates at a limit (?b?0.6?eff) determined by the finite strength of the off-fault material. We speculate that this strength, and not the much smaller dynamically weakened frictional strength, determines the stress levels at which the majority of faults operate.},

The theory was modified from one developed by others in order to properly account for initial overlap of the two surfaces and to allow for calculation of shear stiffnesses under no-slip conditions. Since the theory is critically dependent on the surface topography, a new method is introduced for the derivation of the real topographic parameters. The result of theoretical calculation shows that the normal closure nonlinearly increases with normal stress and is larger for rougher surfaces and that the shear stiffness also nonlinearly increases with normal stress and is greater for smoother surfaces than rougher ones. The verification of the theory will be made by comparing it with experimental data in a companion paper.},

Although the methods and techniques of this approach have originally been developed mainly in engineering tribology, they have been successfully applied to various problems in geophysics, such as the behaviors of joints under normal loads, and under mixed normal and shear loads. The approach has also been applied to investigate the physics of the characteristic displacement appearing in the slip-rate-dependent friction that was observed in experiments made by others. The results obtained by this approach not only predict the experimental observations well, but also reveal the underlying mechanism of various phenomena of contacting surfaces. Since the behavior of contacting surfaces is determined by the micromechanics of asperity contacts, it is recognized to be important, for further progress of this approach, to investigate the detailed mechanism of asperity interactions that includes time-dependent and velocity-dependent deformation processes.},

Previous studies have been done for the slip version. Analytically determined phase plane trajectories and Liapunov function methods are used in this work. The stability results have an extremely simple form: (1) When a constant velocity is imposed at the load point, slip motion is always periodic when the elastic stiffness, K, has a critical value, Kcr. Slip is always stable when K > Kcr > 0, with rate approaching the load-point velocity, and unstable (slip rates within the quasi-static model become unbounded) when K < Kcr. This is unlike results based on the slip version of the state evolution law, in which instability occurs in response to sufficiently large perturbations from steady sliding when K > Kcr. An implication of this result for slip instabilities in continuum systems is that a critical nucleation size of coherent slip has to be attained before unstable slip can ensue. (2) When the load point is stationary, the system stably evolves towards slip at a monotonically decreasing rate whenever K ? Kcr > 0. However, when K < Kcr, initial conditions leading to stable and unstable slip motion exist. Hence self-driven creep modes of instability exist, but only in the latter case.},

  abstract = {Abstract We study numerically the effects of fault roughness on the nucleation process during earthquake sequences. The faults are governed by a rate and state friction law. The roughness introduces local barriers that complicate the nucleation process and result in asymmetric expansion of the rupture, nonmonotonic increase in the slip rates on the fault, and the generation of multiple slip pulses. These complexities are reflected as irregular fluctuations in the moment rate. There is a large difference between first slip events in the sequences and later events. In the first events, for roughness amplitude br ? 0.002, there is a large increase in the nucleation length with increasing br. For larger values of br, slip is mostly aseismic. For the later events there is a trade-off between the effects of the finite fault length and the fault roughness. For br ? 0.002, the finite length is a more dominant factor and the nucleation length barely changes with br. For larger values of br, the roughness plays a larger role and the nucleation length increases significantly with br. Using an energy balance approach, where the roughness is accounted for in the fault stiffness, we derive an approximate solution for the nucleation length on rough faults. The solution agrees well with the main trends observed in the simulations for the later events and provides an estimate of the frictional and roughness properties under which faults experience a transition between seismic and aseismic slip.},

Here we examine the effect of fault roughness in the earthquake nucleation process using the rate and state friction law with the slip evolution law. The nucleation process on rough faults behaves as accelerating and migrating aseismic slip pulse, which is similar to previous studies for flat faults. However, the migration distance on rough faults is much larger than flat faults. The effect of fault roughness on the aseismic slip pulse migration is described by a single parameter known as the roughness drag, which depends on the amplitude, the minimum wavelength, and the Hurst exponent of the fault roughness profile. We also show that aseismic slip pulse cannot accelerate to dynamic rupture and ceases spontaneously if the roughness drag exceeds the static stress drop.},

  abstract = {Because of short recurrence times and known locations, small repeating earthquakes present a rare predictable opportunity for detailed field observations. They are used to study fault creeping velocities, earthquake nucleation, stress drops, and other aspects of tectonophysics, earthquake mechanics, and seismology. An intriguing observation about repeating earthquakes is their scaling of recurrence time with seismic moment, which is significantly different from the scaling based on a simple conceptual model of circular ruptures with stress drop independent of seismic moment and no aseismic slip. Here we show that a model of repeating earthquakes based on laboratory-derived rate and state friction laws reproduces the observed scaling. In the model, a small fault patch governed by steady state velocity-weakening friction is surrounded by a much larger velocity-strengthening region. Long-term slip behavior of the fault is simulated using a methodology that fully accounts for both aseismic slip and inertial effects of occasional seismic events. The model results in repeating earthquakes with typical stress drops and sizes comparable with observations. For a fixed set of friction parameters, the observed scaling is reproduced by varying the size of the velocity-weakening patch. In simulations, a significant part of slip on the velocity-weakening patches is accumulated aseismically, even though the patches also produce seismic events. The proposed model supplies a laboratory-based framework for interpreting the wealth of observations about repeating earthquakes, provides indirect evidence that rate and state friction acts on natural faults, and has important implications for possible scenarios of slip partition into seismic and aseismic parts.},

The observed scaling between recurrence interval and seismic moment, Tr?M1/6, contrasts with expectation assuming constant stress drop and no aseismic slip (Tr?M1/3). Here we demonstrate that simple crack models of velocity-weakening asperities in a velocity-strengthening fault predict the M1/6 scaling; however, the mechanism depends on asperity radius, R. For small asperities ( , where is the nucleation radius) numerical simulations with rate-state friction show interseismic creep penetrating inward from the edge, and earthquakes nucleate in the center and rupture the entire asperity. Creep penetration accounts for ?25\% of the slip budget, the nucleation phase takes up a larger fraction of slip. Stress drop increases with increasing R; the lack of self-similarity being due to the finite nucleation dimension. For simulations exhibit simple cycles with ruptures nucleating from the edge. Asperities with exhibit complex cycles of partial and full ruptures. Here Tr is explained by an energy criterion: full rupture requires that the energy release rate everywhere on the asperity at least equals the fracture energy, leading to the scaling Tr?M1/6. Remarkably, in spite of the variability in behavior with source dimension, the scaling of Tr with stress drop ??, nucleation length and creep rate vpl is the same across all regimes: . This supports the use of repeating earthquakes as creepmeters and provides a physical interpretation for the scaling observed in nature.},

Faults with rate- and state-dependent constitutive properties reproduce a range of observed fault slip phenomena including spontaneous nucleation of slip instabilities at stresses above some critical stress level and recovery of strength following slip instability. Calculations with a plane-strain fault model with spatially varying properties demonstrate that accelerating slip precedes instability and becomes localized to a fault patch. The dimensions of the fault patch follow scaling relations for the minimum critical length for unstable fault slip. The critical length is a function of normal stress, loading conditions and constitutive parameters which include Dc, the characteristic slip distance. If slip starts on a patch that exceeds the critical size, the length of the rapidly accelerating zone tends to shrink to the characteristic size as the time of instability approaches. Solutions have been obtained for a uniform, fixed-patch model that are in good agreement with results from the plane-strain model. Over a wide range of conditions, above the steady-state stress, the logarithm of the time to instability linearly decreases as the initial stress increases. Because nucleation patch length and premonitory displacement are proportional to Dc, the moment of premonitory slip scales by D3c. The scaling of Dc is currently an open question. Unless Dc for earthquake faults is significantly greater than that observed on laboratory faults, premonitory strain arising from the nucleation process for earthquakes may by too small to detect using current observation methods. Excluding the possibility that Dc in the nucleation zone controls the magnitude of the subsequent earthquake, then the source dimensions of the smallest earthquakes in a region provide an upper limit for the size of the nucleation patch.},

  abstract = {Kinematic models of coseismic stress, inverted from ground motion data, do not usually find good correlation between the location of aftershocks and high-stress patches. In particular, numerous earthquakes are recorded in areas of the fault where the stress decreases. However, most of coseismic slip distributions have limited spatial resolution (typically not better than ?1 km). Here we investigate the stress changes produced by the 2004 Mw = 6 Parkfield earthquake on and near its rupture zone, at the scale of magnitude 2 earthquake asperities (approximately tens of meters). After relocating earthquakes in this zone between 1984 and 2007, we form repeating, highly similar earthquake sequences and study how the quasiperiodicity of occurrence at each sequence, observed during the 20 years preceding the 2004 main shock, is perturbed by this event. We apply a simple model of the seismic cycle to infer the coseismic and postseismic stresses experienced by the repeatedly failing asperities. Despite being spatially sparse, these stress distributions have resolutions only limited by the typical scale of an asperity. We propose that the high spatial variability of the seismicity patterns following the Mw = 6 earthquake, results from an heterogeneous coseismic stress field. The emergence of the Omori-Utsu law observed at large-scale (greater than kilometers) at Parkfield is simply the outcome of averaging such quasi-deterministic patterns over many sequences. The fact that the coseismic stress can significantly change over distances of the order of 100 m adds credence to the hypothesis that earthquake rupture is intrinsically very heterogeneous.},

  abstract = {Interfaces possess complex mechanical responses that are governed by several factors including the type of material, the local topography of the interacting surfaces, the stress state and the mode of deformation. This paper examines the mechanics of a mated smooth interface that is subjected to a normal stress and where the contact is perturbed by a circular patch that can experience dilatancy under shear. The analysis of the static stress drop occurring during shear at the interface is examined using a contact mechanics approach that accounts for the separation at the pre-compressed geological interface induced by the development of dilatancy of the patch during relative shear. This paper presents an elementary model of the mechanics that takes into consideration the normal stress evolution during dilatant shearing of the interface. The problem is of particular interest to the modelling of local phenomena that can occur at material interfaces and geological faults that are subjected to steady movement.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe static stress drop of an earthquake, which quantifies the ratio of seismic slip to the size of the rupture, is almost constant over several orders of magnitudes. Although variations are often observed, it is difficult, however, to attribute these variations either to a well-defined phenomenon or simply to measurement uncertainty. In this study we analyze the static stress drop of earthquakes that occurred during a water circulation test in the Soultz-sous-For?ts, France, geothermal reservoir in 2010. During this circulation test, 411 earthquakes were recorded, the largest event having a magnitude MD2.3. We show that several earthquakes in the reservoir can be combined into groups of closely located similar repeating waveforms. We infer that the amplitudes, and hence magnitudes, vary between the repeaters although the waveforms and spectra are both similar in shape. We measure similar corner frequencies for these events despite their different magnitudes, suggesting a similar rupture size. Our results imply that events at the same location may exhibit stress drop variations by as much as a factor of 300. We interpret that this variation in stress drop is caused by fluid pressure at the interface reducing the normal stress. We also hypothesize that the observed variations reflect a transition from stable to unstable slip on the imaged asperities.},

In contrast, the observed variation for small, characteristic repeating earthquakes along a creeping segment of the San Andreas fault at Parkfield (Nadeau and Johnson, 1998) is much weaker. Also, the Parkfield repeating earthquakes have much longer recurrence intervals than expected if the static stress drop is 10 MPa and if the loading velocity VL is assumed equal to the geodetically inferred slip rate of the fault Vf. To resolve these discrepancies, previous studies have assumed no aseismic slip during the interseismic period, implying either high stress drop or VL =? Vf. In this study, we show that a model that includes aseismic slip provides a plausible alternative explanation for the Parkfield repeating earthquakes. Our model of a repeating earthquake is a fixed-area fault patch that is allowed to continuously creep and strain harden until reaching a failure threshold stress. The strain hardening is represented by a linear coefficient C, which when much greater than the elastic loading stiffness k leads to relatively small interseismic slip (stick-slip). When C and k are of similar size creep-slip occurs, in which relatively large aseismic slip accrues prior to failure. Because fault-patch stiffness varies with patch radius, if C is independent of radius, then the model predicts that the relative amount of seismic to total slip increases with increasing radius or M0, consistent with variations in slip required to explain the Parkfield data. The model predicts a weak variation in tr with M0 similar to the Parkfield data.}},

  abstract = {We present a 3-D continuous quasi-dynamic rate-and-state model of multiple seismic asperities forced by surrounding aseismic creep and motivated by observations of coplanar multiplets. Our model allows to study the physics of interactions among a set of asperities. First, we show that the amount of interactions and clustering, characterized by the Omori law and interevent time distribution, depends on how far the system is from a critical density of asperities, which is related to the friction properties of the barriers separating the sources. This threshold controls the ability of a population of asperities to destabilize the creeping barriers between them and therefore determines whether dynamic sequences including several asperities in the same event might occur, in agreement with what is expected from observed magnitude-frequency distributions. Therefore, the concept of critical density of asperity provides a mechanical interpretation of statistical properties of seismicity. As an illustration, we used our numerical results in the specific case of Parkfield in the period preceding the Mw 6, 2004 earthquake, in order to infer the steady state friction parameter (a?b) characterizing the creep of this part of the San Andreas Fault. We estimate a value of (a?b) that locally exceeds 0.001, which is in the upper range of what has already been proposed for the postseimic period of the Mw 6, 2004 Parkfield earthquake.},

  abstract = {Abstract Previous field observations suggest that fault slip surface roughness may decrease with slip. However, measurements have yet to confidently isolate the effect of slip from other possible controls, such as lithology or tectonic setting. We describe the evolution of slip surfaces in normal faults in SE Utah that cut well-sorted, high-porosity sandstones and accommodated regional extension at 1- to 4-km depth. Tight controls on fault offset and uniform tectonic history allowed us to isolate the effect of slip during early stages of faulting (0- to 55-m slip). Slip surfaces progress from rough joints and deformation bands toward smooth, continuous, and mirror-like surfaces with increasing slip. We collected 123 scans of pristine slip surfaces, which measure surface geometry from micrometers to meters in length scale. Results indicate that slip surface roughness is systematically smoother than joint surfaces and deformation band edges. Over the best resolved length scales (0.1Ã??????Ã????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ?????Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ????Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂÃ???Ã?ÂÃÂÃ??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ10 mm), we observe roughness decreases with slip according to a power law with exponent ?1 in the slip direction. Slip-perpendicular profiles, though rougher, exhibit the same smoothing trend. The Hurst scaling exponent does not change with slip. These observations require wear to be multiscale. Boundary element method models suggest that mechanical wear of completely mated surfaces occurs by asperity failure and that the wear rate depends on the aspect ratio of asperities. These results indicate that at large slip, asperity failure at all length scales can cause slip surfaces to smooth while maintaining the fractal geometry characteristic of faults.},

Guglielmi et al. took a crack at monitoring this process in real time with a controlled fluid injection into an inactive fault (see the Perspective by Cornet). Reactivating the dead fault induced aseismic slip, which triggered small earthquakes. These observations can inform models of how friction is related to slip rate. The technique can also be applied to field-scale monitoring of seismicity-inducing wastewater injections.Science, this issue p. 1224; see also p. 1204Anthropogenic fluid injections are known to induce earthquakes. The mechanisms involved are poorly understood, and our ability to assess the seismic hazard associated with geothermal energy or unconventional hydrocarbon production remains limited. We directly measure fault slip and seismicity induced by fluid injection into a natural fault. We observe highly dilatant and slow [~4 micrometers per second (?m/s)] aseismic slip associated with a 20-fold increase of permeability, which transitions to faster slip (~10 ?m/s) associated with reduced dilatancy and micro-earthquakes. Most aseismic slip occurs within the fluid-pressurized zone and obeys a rate-strengthening friction law with v0 = 0.1 ?m/s.

  abstract = {We present a model which predicts seismological complexity even with no complexity in geometry or heterogeneity in material properties. Fault slip is numerically modeled using a Dieterich-type rate and state variable friction law at the planar interface of two infinitely long massless elastic slabs. A constant velocity boundary condition is imposed a distance H from each interface. No geometrical, frictional, elastic, or remote loading variations are allowed in the direction parallel to the plane of the fault. In the numerical solution a periodic boundary condition is imposed, and the fault surface is divided into N subregions each of which is represented by a mathematical point. At these N points, all of which are mutually coupled by discretized two-dimensional elasticity solutions, the friction law differential equations are numerically solved. The character of the solutions depends on model parameter values and initial conditions. Solutions are found that are periodic, quasi-periodic, or aperiodic in time; and that are spatially homogeneous for all time, nearly homogeneous except during fast slip events, or essentially inhomogeneous for all time. For given parameter values the solutions have a qualitative character which is nearly independent of initial conditions. At any instant in time these solutions ultimately appear roughly as some superposition of those spatial sine waves which are unstable in a linearized calculation. When spatially complex, the solutions can simultaneously exhibit regions that have steady sliding, large slip rates, and local propagating creep events. Special initial conditions can generate other solutions such as steady propagating creep waves that span the whole fault. The variety of simulated slip motions and long-term patterns of slip predicted by this spatially homogeneous nonlinear dynamical model suggests a possible role for dynamics, and not just complex geological structure, as a generator of temporal and spatial complexity in seismic phenomena.},

  abstract = {Does a large earthquake have a large quasi-static preparation? A hierarchical asperity model in which a large tough patch (Patch L) contains smaller fragile patches (Patch S) enables a large earthquake to start with only small preparation because of cascade-up rupture growth. We realized such a model in a rate-and-state framework by heterogeneous distributions of the state evolution distance, and its consequences are investigated by earthquake sequence simulations. Focus is put on elementary processes, the interaction between two scales: one Patch L containing one Patch S is simulated, with their size ratio as a parameter. If Patch S is larger than the nucleation size of Patch L, the system falls into a limit cycle consisting of only one earthquake that starts with Patch S nucleation and grows dynamically to rupture entire Patch L. If Patch S is considerably smaller than the nucleation size of Patch L, small earthquakes never dynamically cascade-up, and the large earthquakes are initiated by large quasi-static nucleation. In between, large earthquakes start in various ways: by large nucleation, dynamic cascade-up, or delayed cascade-up. In the final stage of quasi-static nucleation, the preseismic moment release rate increases roughly inversely proportional to the time-to-failure tf with its amplitude depending on the nucleation size. For a Patch S rupture to cascade up, strength in the adjacent region must have been reduced, manifested by a higher creep velocity before the Patch S nucleation starts following 1/tf acceleration. Large nucleation sometimes has a precursory small earthquake characterized by larger afterslip than nonprecursory ones.},

If foreshocks behaved differently, this would suggest a change of physical processes in the mainshock preparation phase that would boost hopes of forecasting large earthquakes. Most research on foreshocks focuses on case studies or uses global datasets in which recordings of small earthquakes are incomplete and are thus neglected. We do comprehensive foreshock statistics on all mainshocks in a regional earthquake catalog that is complete above MÃÂ 2.5. To detect possible differences between foreshocks and seismicity that follows a uniform triggering model (the epidemic?type aftershock sequence [ETAS] model), we perform a null?hypothesis test. We also estimate the size of the differences between observed and ETAS?simulated foreshocks.We define different sets of foreshocks using two different methods, because there is no unique definition: a nearest?neighbor declustering technique (Zaliapin etÃÂ al., 2008) and a variety of spaceÃÂtime windows (e.g., Agnew and Jones, 1991). We use data from southern California, northern California, and Italy. For each region, we first search an appropriate null model: an ETAS model that describes aftershock numbers well. In southern California, we find an appropriate spatiotemporal model that is characterized by a large productivity parameter ?. After performing a null?hypothesis test for different mainshock and foreshock magnitudes, we find foreshock signals (p\\&lt;0.05) for all mainshocks sizes and independent of the foreshockÃÂs lower magnitude threshold. Observed mainshocks have more foreshocks than the ETAS model predicts.}},

  abstract = {We were able to successfully capture rupture nucleation processes on a 2-D fault surface during large-scale biaxial friction experiments using metagabbro rock specimens. Several rupture nucleation patterns have been detected by a strain gauge array embedded inside the rock specimens as well as by that installed along the edge walls of the fault. In most cases, the unstable rupture started just after the rupture front touched both ends of the rock specimen (i.e., when rupture front extended to the entire width of the fault). In some cases, rupture initiated at multiple locations and the rupture fronts coalesced to generate unstable ruptures, which could only be detected from the observation inside the rock specimen. Therefore, we need to carefully examine the 2-D nucleation process of the rupture especially when analyzing the data measured only outside the rock specimen. At least the measurements should be done at both sides of the fault to identify the asymmetric rupture propagation on the fault surface, although this is not perfect yet. In the present experiment, we observed three typical types of the 2-D rupture propagation patterns, two of which were initiated at a single location either close to the fault edge or inside the fault. This initiation could be accelerated by the free surface effect at the fault edge. The third one was initiated at multiple locations and had a rupture coalescence at the middle of the fault. These geometrically complicated rupture initiation patterns are important for understanding the earthquake nucleation process in nature.},

Laboratory studies on tremor-like acoustic emission events generated during preslip may shed some light on the above issues. We conducted stick-slip experiments and observed tremor-like events and preslip in the laboratory. The results show the following. (1) The dominant frequency of tremor-like events increases with accelerating preslip. (2) The evolution of tremor-like events is spatiotemporally consistent with that of preslip. (3) Interactions between preslip and high-frequency events indicate the formation of a positive feedback effect between the expansion of preslip and failure of asperities, which leads to stick-slip instability. Thus, we propose that tremors may be caused by stress variations derived from asperity interactions along fault surfaces at dry conditions. The increasing dominant frequency of tremors may imply the accelerating preslip of an upcoming earthquake.},

  abstract = {Abstract Geodetic observations and large-scale laboratory experiments show that seismic instability is preceded by slow slip within a finite nucleation zone. In laboratory experiments rupture nucleation is studied mostly using bare (rock) interfaces, whereas upper crustal faults are typically filled with gouge. To investigate effects of gouge on nucleation, we performed a biaxial shearing experiment on a 350 mm long saw-cut fault filled with gypsum gouge, at room temperature and a minimum horizontal stress ?2 = 0.3-5 MPa. The gouge layer was sandwiched between polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates For reference also a fault without gouge was deformed.. Strain gauges and DIC measurements were used to monitor the deformation field along the fault zone margins. Stick-slip behavior occurred on both the gouge-filled fault and the PMMA fault. Nucleation of instability on the PMMA fault persistently occurred from one location 2/3 along the fault, but nucleation on the gouge-filled fault was more variable, nucleating at the ends and/or at ~2/3 along the fault, with precursory slip occurring over a large fraction of the fault. Nucleation correlated to regions of high fault stress ratio ?/?n, which were more variable for the gouge-filled fault due to small length-scale variations in normal stress caused by heterogeneous gouge compaction. Rupture velocities and slip rates were lower for the gouge-filled fault than for the bare PMMA fault. Stick-slip persisted when ?2 was lowered and the nucleation zone length increased, expanding from the center to the sample ends before transitioning into instability.},

Many of the laboratory observations are consistent with previous work that showed a slow and smoothly accelerating earthquake nucleation process that expands to a critical nucleation length scale Lc, before it rapidly accelerates to dynamic fault rupture. The experiments also highlight complexities not currently considered by most theoretical and numerical models. This includes a loading rate dependency where a ÃÂkickÃÂ above steady state produces smaller and more abrupt initiation. Heterogeneity of fault strength also causes abrupt initiation when creep fronts coalesce on a stuck patch that is somewhat stronger than the surrounding fault. Taken together, these two mechanisms suggest a rate-dependent ÃÂcascade upÃÂ model for earthquake initiation. This model simultaneously accounts for foreshocks that are a by-product of a larger nucleation process and similarities between initial P wave signatures of small and large earthquakes. A diversity of nucleation conditions are expected in the Earth's crust, ranging from slip limited environments with Lc < 1 m, to ignition-limited environments with Lc > 10 km. In the latter case, Lc fails to fully characterize the initiation process since earthquakes nucleate not because a slipping patch reaches a critical length but because fault slip rate exceeds a critical power density needed to ignite dynamic rupture.},

We also consider slip-dependent stress accumulation on patches prior to the weakening process. When two patches of different size are superposed, the slip rate of the smaller patch is reduced when the stress is increased on the surrounding large patch. In the case of many patches over a range of scales, the slip rate on the smaller patches becomes significant in terms of both its amplitude and frequency. Peaks in slip rate are controlled by the surrounding larger patches, which may also be responsible for the segmentation of slip sequences. The use of an explicit slip-strengthening-then-weakening frictional behavior highlights that the strengthening process behind small patches weakens their interaction and reduces the peaks in slip rate, while the slip deficit continues to accumulate in the background. Therefore, it may be possible to image the progress of slip deficit at larger scales if the changes in slip activity on small patches are detectable.},

We employed a hypocenter relocation method based on waveform cross-correlations of the above four families, as well as a waveform inversion method using the empirical GreenÃÂs function for the Naka-Oki and Kushiro-Oki earthquakes, where every moderate-size repeating earthquake showed complex and variable rupture processes. However, their rupture areas overlapped significantly and were elongate parallel to the slip direction. Some parts of these areas were also repeatedly ruptured by smaller earthquakes, with these smaller earthquakes and moderate events sometimes following almost identical rupture processes. The results indicate the existence of a characteristic structure that is represented by several elliptical patches that are elongate in the slip direction of the plate interface. It is likely that many streak structures have developed over a 1000ÃÂ km along-strike section of the plate interface that extends from the Kushiro-Oki region to the Naka-Oki region of the subduction zone. These patches may be distributed hierarchically, with the smaller patches rupturing independently. The rupture of a smaller patch may either stop, producing a small earthquake, or it may grow into a large earthquake, with this rupture process depending on subtle differences in the physical conditions that we are unable to observe in a practical sense. Earthquakes are random processes, but they may not be completely random, as the preexisting characteristic structure of the seismic region may control the rupture process to some degree.},

  abstract = {Seismic shear waves released by an earthquake typically far outpace motion along the fault surface. Occasionally, however, earthquakes along strike-slip faults appear to propagate so that the rupture velocity is faster than shear waves, creating a sort of sonic boom along the fault surface. Passel?gue et al. (p. 1208) were able to reproduce and measure these so-called supershear ruptures in stick-slip experiments with two pieces of granite under high applied normal stress. Much like during a sonic boom when a plane travels faster than the speed of sound, the ruptures created a shock wave in the form of a Mach cone around the rupture front.Supershear earthquake ruptures propagate faster than the shear wave velocity. Although there is evidence that this occurs in nature, it has not been experimentally demonstrated with the use of crustal rocks. We performed stick-slip experiments with Westerly granite under controlled upper-crustal stress conditions. Supershear ruptures systematically occur when the normal stress exceeds 43 megapascals (MPa) with resulting stress drops on the order of 3 to 25 MPa, comparable to the stress drops inferred by seismology for crustal earthquakes. In our experiments, the sub-Rayleigh-to-supershear transition length is a few centimeters at most, suggesting that the rupture of asperities along a fault may propagate locally at supershear velocities. In turn, these sudden accelerations and decelerations could play an important role in the generation of high-frequency radiation and the overall rupture-energy budget.},

Ample observations document the spatial variability in interseismic coupling, defined as a degree of locking of a fault during the period of stress build-up between seismic events: fully or nearly locked fault patches are often surrounded by aseismically creeping areas. However, it is unclear how these observations could help assess future earthquakes. Here we simulate spontaneous seismic and aseismic fault slip with a fully dynamic numerical model. Our simulations establish the dependence of earthquake rupture patterns and interseismic coupling on spatial variations of fault friction. We consider the long-term evolution of slip on a model fault where two seismogenic, locked segments are separated by an aseismically slipping patch where rupture is impeded. We find that the probability for a large earthquake to break through the rupture-impeding patch is correlated with the interseismic coupling averaged over this patch. In addition, the probability that an earthquake breaks through the rupture-impeding patch and interseismic coupling are both related to fault friction properties through a single non-dimensional parameter. Our study opens the possibility of predicting seismic rupture patterns that a fault system can produce on the basis of observations of its interseismic coupling, and suggests that regions of low interseismic coupling may reveal permanent barriers to large earthquakes.},

Using a three-dimensional finite difference method, we analyze the effect of asperity radius, strength, and depth in a dynamic model with fixed rupture velocity. We gradually add complexity to the model, eventually approaching the behavior of a spontaneous dynamic rupture, to determine the origin of each feature in the ground motion. A barrier initially resists rupture, which induces rupture front curvature. These effects focus energy on and off the fault, leading to a concentrated pulse from the barrier region and higher velocities at the surface. Finally, we investigate the scaling laws in a spontaneous dynamic model. We find that dynamic stress drop determines fault-parallel static offset, while the time it takes the barrier to break is a measure of fracture energy. Thus, given sufficiently strong heterogeneity, the prestress and yield stress (relative to sliding friction) of the barrier can both be determined from ground motion measurements. In addition, we find that models with constraints on rupture velocity have less ground motion than constraint-free spontaneous dynamic models with equivalent stress drops. This suggests that kinematic models with such constraints overestimate the actual stress heterogeneity of earthquakes.},

The FMD takes the form N(m) ? exp(??m)q(m) where N(m) is the event number, m the magnitude, exp(??m) the Gutenberg-Richter law and q(m) a detection function. q(m) is commonly defined as the cumulative Normal distribution to describe the gradual curvature of bulk FMDs. Recent results however suggest that this gradual curvature is due to Mc heterogeneities, meaning that the functional shape of the elemental FMD has yet to be described. We propose a detection function of the form q(m) = exp(?(m ? Mc)) for m < Mc and q(m) = 1 for m ? Mc, which leads to an FMD of angular shape. The two FMD models are compared in earthquake catalogs from Southern California and Nevada and in synthetic catalogs. We show that the angular FMD model better describes the elemental FMD and that the sum of elemental angular FMDs leads to the gradually curved bulk FMD. We propose an FMD shape ontology consisting of 5 categories depending on the Mc spatial distribution, from Mc constant to Mc highly heterogeneous: (I) Angular FMD, (II) Intermediary FMD, (III) Intermediary FMD with multiple maxima, (IV) Gradually curved FMD and (V) Gradually curved FMD with multiple maxima. We also demonstrate that the gradually curved FMD model overestimates Mc. This study provides new insights into earthquake detectability properties by using seismicity as a proxy and the means to accurately estimate Mc in any given volume.},

The power-law behavior of many natural processes is only observed above a threshold below which information is discarded due to detection limitations. These incomplete data can however also be described by a power law, and the distribution over the full quantity range reformulated as an asymmetric Laplace (AL) distribution. With the detection process heterogeneous in space and time in realistic conditions, the data can be modelled by a mixture of AL components. Using seismicity as example, we describe an asymmetric Laplace mixture model (ALMM), which considers ambiguous overlapping components - as observed in Nature - based on a semi-supervised hard Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the ALMM fits reasonably well incomplete data and that the number of AL components can be related to the seismic network density. We conclude that the full range of data can be used in statistical analyses, including in computer vision. In the case of seismicity, a ten-fold increase in sample size is possible which provides, for example, a better spatial pattern resolution to improve the correlation between fault features and earthquake labels.},

Although most M > 7.5 earthquakes have occurred without detectable pre-earthquake deformation, the detection threshold for aseismic deformation remains high, in that aseismic slip with moment equivalent to an M5 earthquake would in most (although not all) cases have been missed. Interseismic deformation rates vary without being followed by earthquakes, and a strain-rate change prior to the 1989 Mw6.9 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake is shown to be similar in size to many other rate changes that have occurred since that time. Most examples of pre-earthquake aseismic deformation lasting hundreds of seconds or more probably originate adjacent to, or downdip of, the seismic rupture plane, rather than within the zone that undergoes seismic failure. },

We performed 27 friction experiments in a compression-torsion apparatus on ring-shaped limestone samples at sub-seismic to seismic slip rates ?340ÃÂ mm/s, centimetric displacements and normal stresses of ?8ÃÂ MPa. Friction decreases dramatically at slip rates of 50ÃÂ150ÃÂ mm/s. Flash weakening was contemporaneous with a peripheral temperature rise of ?90ÃÂ ÃÂ°C measured with an infrared camera. The peripheral temperature yields a lower limit to the slipping zone temperature. The decrease in friction may result from weakening of the asperity contacts due to decarbonation of calcite induced by (1) flash heating or (2) mechanically-activated reactions. However, X-Ray powder diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy analyses do not reveal the presence of decarbonation products in the slipping zone. Instead, White Light Interferometry and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope observations reveal the presence of a smooth sliding surface made of nanometric-particles. The mechanical data can be fit by the rate- and state-dependent friction model or by a quadratic model (the latter proposed for powder lubrication). We conclude that flash heating and weakening and powder lubrication may operate together to decrease dynamic friction in limestone in experiments and, for the conditions investigated here, in nature.},

  abstract = {Principal slip zones often contain highly reflective surfaces referred to as fault mirrors, shown to consist of a nanogranular coating. There is currently no consensus on how the nanograins form, or why they survive weathering on a geological time-scale. To simplify the complex system of a natural fault zone, where slip and heat generation are inherently coupled, we investigated the effect of elevated temperatures on carbonate rock surfaces, as well as their resistance to water exposure. This allows us to isolate the role of the decarbonation process in the formation of nanograins. We used cleaved crystals of Iceland spar calcite, manually polished dolomite protolith, as well as natural dolomite fault mirror surfaces. The samples were heated to 200-800?ÃÂ°C in a ?5 h heating cycle, followed by slow cooling (?12 h) to room temperature. Subsequently, we imaged the samples using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Nanograin formation on all sample surfaces was pervasive at and above 600?ÃÂ°C. The Foiana fault mirror samples were initially coated with aligned naturally-formed nanograins, but display a non-directional nanogranular coating after heating. The nanograins that were formed by heating rapidly recrystallized to bladed hydroxides upon exposure to deionized water, whereas the nanograins on unheated fault mirror samples remained unchanged in water. This shows that the nanograins formed by heating alone are different from those formed in fault zones, and calls for a better characterization of nanograins and their formation mechanisms. Furthermore, we find a characteristic star-shaped crack pattern associated with reacted regions of the carbonate surfaces. The existence of this pattern implies that the mechanical stresses set up by the decarbonation reaction can be sufficiently large to drive fracturing in these systems. We propose that this mechanism may contribute to grain size reduction in fault zones.},

Flow and shear textures within the coating suggest that this composite material is smeared over the damage zone during ice sliding, forming a smooth surface. The coating can potentially change the shear resistance and erosion rates at the bed of temperate glaciers and likely explains the relative resistance of glacial polish to postglacial weathering.},

For intermediate normal pressures, the transition between the two regimes was controlled by the roughness and slip rates. In this last case, slip motion was steady at high slip rates for the range of grades of roughness considered, and at all slip rates for the roughest surfaces. In other conditions, we observed stick-slip. In the case of steady sliding, the dynamic coefficient of friction decreased linearly with the logarithm of increasing sliding velocity. Furthermore, this coefficient of friction and its variations with slip velocity were lower for smooth surfaces. For stick-slip motion, the static coefficient of friction was mostly influenced by normal pressure. For the three highest normal pressures, the static coefficient of friction decreased linearly when normal pressure increased. This coefficient was not influenced by slip rate and showed a slight increase when the roughness of the sliding surfaces increased.},

We vary particle size distribution, grain and surface roughness, and gouge layer thickness to better understand how grain sliding, rolling, dilation, and compaction affect the strength and stability of granular fault gouge. The experiments employed the double direct shear testing geometry and were run at room temperature, controlled humidity, and shearing rates from 0.1 to 3000 ?m/s. Experiments were carried out under constant normal stress of 5 and 10 MPa and thus within a nonfracture loading regime where sliding friction for smooth, spherical particles is measurably lower than for rough, angular particles. We compare results from shear between smooth boundaries, where we hypothesize that grain boundary sliding is the dominant deformation mechanism, and roughened surfaces, where rolling and granular dilation contribute to shear deformation. We find that particle angularity and bounding surface roughness increase the frictional strength within sheared layers, indicating differences in particle reorganization due to these factors. In gouge material composed of <30% angular grains we observe repetitive stick-slip sliding where stress drop decreases while preinstability creep increases with increasing gouge layer thickness. Our data show significant differences in stick-slip characteristics as a function of gouge layer thickness and particle size, which we interpret in terms of the mechanics of grain bridges that support forces on the layers. We suggest that force chains exhibit qualitative differences as a function of grain angularity and bounding surface roughness.},

  abstract  = {Crustal deformation patterns are affected by multiscale granulation and healing processes associated with phase transitions between continuum and discrete states of rocks. The ongoing continuum-discrete transitions are accompanied by progressive evolution of disordered fault networks to dominant localized fault zones, development of bimaterial interfaces, and increasing dynamic weakening of fault surfaces. Results on individual fault zones point to three general dynamic regimes. The first is associated with broad range of heterogeneities, little dynamic weakening, power law frequency-size statistics, temporal clustering of intermediate and large events, and accelerated seismic release before large earthquakes. The second is associated with relatively uniform localized structures, significant dynamic weakening, characteristic earthquake statistics, and quasi-periodic temporal occurrence of large events without precursory accelerated release. For a range of conditions, the fault zone response can switch back and forth between the foregoing two dynamic regimes. Higher temperature, fluid content, and thickness of sedimentary cover reduce the seismic coupling in a region and change the properties of local earthquake sequences. Brittle regions with high seismic coupling have few foreshocks and long-duration aftershock sequences with high event productivity, whereas more viscous regions with low seismic coupling have increased foreshocks activity and low-productivity aftershock sequences or swarms. The results provide criteria for organizing data in classes associated with different evolutionary stages and different regional conditions. An ability to recognize the dynamic regime of a given fault zone or a region can increase the information content of the data and lead to improved strategies for seismic hazard assessment.},

  abstract = {{Earthquakes occur along faults in response to plate tectonic movements, but paradoxically, are not widely recognized in the geological record, severely limiting our knowledge of earthquake physics and hampering accurate assessments of seismic hazard. Light-reflective (so-called mirror like) fault surfaces are widely observed geological features, especially in carbonate-bearing rocks of the shallow crust. Here we report on the occurrence of mirror-like fault surfaces cutting dolostone gouges in the Italian Alps. Using friction experiments, we demonstrate that the mirror-like surfaces develop only at seismic slip rates (?1 m/s) and for applied normal stresses and sliding displacements consistent with those estimated on the natural faults. Under these experimental conditions, the frictional power density dissipated in the samples is comparable to that estimated for natural earthquakes (1ÃÂ10 MW/m2). Our results indicate that mirror-like surfaces in dolostone gouges are a signature of seismic faulting, and can be used to estimate power dissipation during ancient earthquake ruptures.}},

  abstract = {Dynamic reduction of fault strength is a key process during earthquake rupture. Many mechanisms for causing coseismic weakening have been proposed based on theory and laboratory experiments, including silica gel lubrication. However, few have been observed in nature. Here we report on the first documented occurrence of a natural silica gel coating a fault surface. The Corona Heights fault slickenside in San Francisco, California, is covered by a shiny layer of translucent silica. Microstructures in this layer show flow banding, armored clasts, and extreme comminution compared to adjacent cataclasites. The layer is composed of ?100 nm to 1 ÃÂµm grains of quartz, hydrous crystalline silica, and amorphous silica, with 10-100 nm inclusions of Fe oxides and ellipsoidal silica colloids. Kinematic indicators and mixing with adjacent cataclasites suggest the shiny layer was fluid during fault slip. The layer therefore represents a relict silica gel that formed during fault motion, and which could have resulted in frictional instability. These observations confirm that the silica gels formed in rock friction experiments do occur in natural faults and therefore that silica gel formation can act as a dynamic weakening mechanism in faults at shallow crustal conditions.},

  abstract  = {Summary Recent seismological observations have highlighted increasing foreshock activity preceding the failure of large earthquakes. Foreshock sequences seem to be the signature of a precursory slip during the nucleation of earthquakes, as observed both prior the Tohoku-Oki Mw 9.0 and the recent Iquique 2014 Mw 8.1 earthquakes. Advances in laboratory experiments allow researchers to reproduce seismic ruptures and to study the earthquake nucleation phase. Here, we track the occurrence of precursory activity prior to stick-slip instabilities in crustal rocks. An exponential acceleration of the precursory slip is systematically observed. This exponential growth implies that (i) the nucleation phase has a characteristic time, (ii) the amount of precursory slip scales with the fracture energy of the fault,and (iii) the moment released seismically by foreshocks also increases exponentially with increasing fault strength. In summary, under upper crustal conditions, the intensity of precursory processes scales with the fracture energy of the largest asperity, which is eventually going to rupture. The larger the fracture energy of the main asperity, the larger the amount of precursory slip and the larger the amount of precursory slip released seismically.},

  abstract  = {Previously we verified experimentally that a generalized form of the Greenwood-Williamson theory describing the elastic contact of two random surfaces adequately predicts the closure of joints in fused silica glass samples. Here we present a similar analysis for experiments on rock. We have tested the theory quantitatively by comparing joint closure from experiment with joint closure predicted by the theory. These comparisons were made using topography data from the surfaces of the joints used in the closure experiments. Three types of tests were done: (1) Granite and quartzite samples were studied where the joints consisted of surfaces ground with #80 and #60 grits. Here the surfaces were random and uncorrelated with each other. These experiments permitted a direct test of the theory. As with the experiments on glass, the theory agrees with experiment. However, uncertainty in the values of the elastic constants for rock result in larger possible errors in predicting joint closure. (2) Tension fractures in granite and quartzite samples were studied. Here the surfaces were highly correlated with each other. The amount of closure expected for correlated surfaces depends on the degree of correlation, since this determines the effective roughness of the joint. Here the surface topography was repeatedly high-pass filtered and the theory compared with experiment at each stage to determine the effective scale over which the surfaces were mismatched. (3) Ground surfaces of marble were subjected to the same loading conditions. Here the elastic assumption was no longer appropriate. These experiments are an example that the limit of elastic deformation is reached for all materials for surface asperities below a given dimension. This dimension is related to the indentation hardness of the material, which is lower for calcite than for silicate minerals.},

The method of numerical generation of arbitrarily oriented three-dimensional rough surfaces is presented. The procedure of digital simulation of two-process surface is introduced. An idea of the proposed method (and its possible modifications) is imposition of random surface of Gaussian ordinate distribution (second process) on the base surface (first process). The examples of using this method for the simulation of plateau honed cylinder surface, cylinder and piston skirt surfaces after zero-wear processes are given. In each case the matching criteria of real and simulated surface topographies are presented.},

  abstract  = {Machine elements such as seals, piston rings and bearings commonly operate in the mixed friction regime. Here, lubrication leakage and friction depend on surface roughness. Previous authors have described how two process preparations such as grinding followed by honing, result in a beneficial surface texture characterised by plateau regions interspersed by deeper pockets and channels. (For reasons explained in this paper, such surfaces are herein described as bi-Gaussian.) However, in applications such as mechanical seals, a very similar surface topography is exhibited after wear, sometimes in excess of 1mm. This means that the texture must be self-replicating and not simply the result of wearing-in by truncation of larger-scale roughness asperities left by the preparation process. This suggests that a combination of the wear process and the material microstructure is responsible for the worn surface texture. Thus a given microstructure would result in a particular self-replicating bi-Gaussian surface texture. Characterising such surfaces with simple parameters and understanding how they behave in sliding contact, makes it possible to optimise the texture for given operating conditions. It is then possible, in principle, to specify a microstructure to produce the in-service surface texture for optimum functional performance in a given duty. This paper presents the mathematical description of the bi-Gaussian surface and considers its elastic contact with a smooth plain counterface in terms of plateau-top asperity characteristics obtained using low-cost profilometry equipment. The validity of an elastic contact model is discussed. Finally an outline of the application of the contact model to a particular case of mixed friction sliding is outlined, to illustrate the potential for surface texture optimisation.},

Many experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between AE parameters and wear and friction. This paper develops a theoretical model to correlate acoustic emissions to sliding friction based on elastic asperity contact of materials. It is found that sliding speed, load supported by asperities, the number of asperity contact and surface topographic characteristics influence the energy of AE signal. With the help of this model it is possible to estimate the contact load supported by asperities from AE measurement, which is a critical parameter to evaluate lubrication conditions in engineering applications. The establishment of this model will provide a theoretical basis for future studies on the motioning and prognostics of tribological process using AE technology.},

A deterministic AE RMS model is established and applied to real and simulated surfaces to reveal the mechanism of bi-Gaussian stratified topographies on generating AE RMSs.

The surface-height RMS value and the proportion of the upper component are, respectively, positively and negatively related to the AE RMS value by affecting the summit density and curvature radius.},
